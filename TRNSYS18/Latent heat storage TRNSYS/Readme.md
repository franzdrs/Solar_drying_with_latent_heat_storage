This Type calculates the performance of a latent heat storage unit consisting of a number of parallel rectangular slabs filled with PCM. The slabs are separated by air gaps through which air flows. The model is in 2D, so the length and thickness of the slab is modelled while the conditions along the width are considered constant. There are three main differential equations: for the flowing air, the slab wall and the PCM. The user must give the air, PCM and slab wall properties as well as other parameters. The equations are solved using finite differences. The enthalpy formulation is used for the phase change. The user can input different but constant properties for the liquid and solid phase of the PCM (density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity). The PCM is assumed to melt in a temperature range defined by the user. The user defines the centerpoint of the range and the width of the range. The model can also be used for isothermal phase change by simply using a very narrow temperature range (i.e. 0.1 K) which virtually gives the same results as true isothermal phase change.
