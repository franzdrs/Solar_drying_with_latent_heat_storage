This Type describes the operation of a back pass, single cover, solar air heater (SAH). The model is one-dimensional and transient in nature. The main model components are four partial differential equations for cover, absorber plate, air flow and bottom plate. The user must provide the SAH dimensions as well as material properties of the collector components and air. The length of the SAH is divided in a number of sections defined by the user and the equations are solved in the nodes using the finite difference method. The equations are solved iteratively until the convergence criteria (also defined by the user) are met.
